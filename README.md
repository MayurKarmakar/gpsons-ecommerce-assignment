# GPSONS Ecommerce

This project is a chatbot assignment built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It features to browse through various product categories, view detailed information about each product, login and user registration pages and the shopping cart page.

## Note on APIs

This application utilizes REST API services from [FakeApiStore.com](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for data fetching and management. These services provide mock data suitable for development and testing purposes, enabling us to simulate a real-world e-commerce environment without relying on live data sources.
